                                            <--WHAT IS ROUTING-->

Routes : The URL/Link to open any page which a user can see is known as the ROUTE

Advance Routing features proivided by Laravel =>

1.  remove the extension if required i.e. can use app/home instead of app/home.php
2.  can open the file with a different named route apart from the filename

                                            <--HOW TO MAKE A ROUTE -->

To create a new page :
New File -> home.blade.php

<h1>Home Page</h1>

In order to display this :
Need to add a Route

In Routes folder --
In web.php file --

ADD NEW CODE

Route::get('/home', function () {
return view('home');
});

Thus, on the output on browser,

ON http://127.0.0.1:8000/home
we get : <h1>Home Page</h1>

ON http://127.0.0.1:8000
we get : <h1>Hello</h1>

                                            <--OPEN ANY VIEW WITH ROUTING -->

In order to open a view, we have 2 methods

METHOD 1 =
Route::get('/home', function () {
return view('home');
});

METHOD 2=
Route::view('/home' , 'home');
{This shortcut method can only be used to open a view
But, if we want to open any Controllers, we need to only use method 1}

                                    <--PASSING DATA IN ROUTING // RENDERING DYNAMIC CONTENT--->

Make a new view : about.blade.php

<h1>Hello</h1>
<h1>This is About Page</h1>
<h1>Good to see you {{$name}} sir</h1>

Make its Route ==>>

Route::get('/about/{name}', function ($name) {
echo "Username -> $name";
return view('about', ['name' => $name]);
});

On Browser ==>>

http://127.0.0.1:8000/about/
ERROR (bcoz no additional name info give in the route path)

http://127.0.0.1:8000/about/messi
Username -> messi
Hello
This is About Page
Good to see you messi sir

                                    <--WORKING OF ANCHOR TAGS--->

we use anchor tags to jump from one page to other
this can also be done with the help of Routes

In our Starting welcome.blade.php page =>

<h1>Hello </h1>

<h3>Click below to go on other Pages</h3>
<a href="/home">Home</a>
<a href="/about/sami">About Sami</a>

                                    <--OTHER ROUTING METHODS used in api and forms--->

Route::get($uri, $callback);
Route::post($uri, $callback);
Route::put($uri, $callback);
Route::patch($uri, $callback);
Route::delete($uri, $callback);
Route::options($uri, $callback);
