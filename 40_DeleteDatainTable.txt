In prev lec, we displayed the employee table data in tabular format
Now, we will add a DELETE link next to each employee name which when clicked, EMPLOYEE SHOULD BE DELETED AND RETURN BACK TO SAME MODIFIED TABLE 

how to? 

Lets add a delete anchor link in our view file => HERE, WE TAKE THE EMPLOYEE ID FOR DELETION PURPOSE
In list-employee.blade.php => 

<div>
    <h1>EMPLOYEE LIST</h1>
    {{-- {{print_r($employeedata)}}  --}}
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>ID</th>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Email</th>
            <th>Phone</th>
            <th>Created At</th>
            <th>Updated At</th>
            <th>Operations</th>
        </tr>

        @foreach ($employeedata as $emp )
            <tr>
                <td>{{$emp->id}}</td>
                <td>{{$emp->name}}</td>
                <td>{{$emp->email}}</td>
                <td>{{$emp->phone}}</td>
                <td>{{$emp->created_at}}</td>
                <td>{{$emp->updated_at}}</td>
            //THIS IS NEW ANCHOR LINK ADDED FOR DELETE EMPLOYEE 
                <td><a href="{{ url('deleteemployee/'.$emp->id) }}">Delete</a></td>
            </tr>
        @endforeach
    </table>
</div>



In web.php =>
//lec40 delete data from employee table
Route::get('/deleteemployee/{id}' , [EmployeeController::class , 'delete']) ; 


In EmployeeController.php =>

   function delete($id){
        $isDeleted = Employee::destroy($id) ; 
        //If successfully destroyed/deleted , $isDeleted value = 1 ELSE $isDeleted value = 0
        if($isDeleted){
            return redirect('listemployee') ; 
        }
   }

This successfully helps in Deleting any Employee =>

### Deleting an Employee from the Table

#### Steps to Delete Data from the Database

**1. Add a Delete Link in the View**

Update the `list-employee.blade.php` file to include a delete link for each employee. This link will point to a route that handles the deletion:

```html
<div>
    <h1>EMPLOYEE LIST</h1>
    {{-- {{print_r($employeedata)}}  --}}
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>ID</th>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Email</th>
            <th>Phone</th>
            <th>Created At</th>
            <th>Updated At</th>
            <th>Operations</th>
        </tr>

        @foreach ($employeedata as $emp)
            <tr>
                <td>{{ $emp->id }}</td>
                <td>{{ $emp->name }}</td>
                <td>{{ $emp->email }}</td>
                <td>{{ $emp->phone }}</td>
                <td>{{ $emp->created_at }}</td>
                <td>{{ $emp->updated_at }}</td>
                <td><a href="{{ url('deleteemployee/'.$emp->id) }}">Delete</a></td>
            </tr>
        @endforeach
    </table>
</div>
```

**2. Define the Route**

Add a route in `web.php` to handle the deletion of an employee. This route will call the `delete` method in the `EmployeeController`:

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\EmployeeController;

// lec40 delete data from employee table
Route::get('/deleteemployee/{id}', [EmployeeController::class, 'delete']);
```

**3. Implement the Delete Method in the Controller**

In `EmployeeController.php`, add a method to handle the deletion of an employee record:

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use App\Models\Employee;

class EmployeeController extends Controller
{
    public function list()
    {
        $alldata = Employee::all();
        return view('list-employee', ['employeedata' => $alldata]);
    }

    public function delete($id)
    {
        $isDeleted = Employee::destroy($id); // Delete the record by ID
        if ($isDeleted) {
            return redirect('listemployee'); // Redirect to the employee list after deletion
        }
    }
}
```

**4. Test the Deletion Functionality**

Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/listemployee` to see the list of employees with the delete links. Click on the "Delete" link next to an employee to remove the record from the database.

**Expected Output:**

Initial Table:

```
EMPLOYEE LIST
-----------------------------------------------------------
ID  | Name            | Email                       | Phone  | Created At           | Updated At           | Operations
-----------------------------------------------------------
3   | Rahul Malhotra  | rahul@faang.com             | 4563   | 2024-07-03 04:32:17  | 2024-07-03 04:32:17  | Delete
4   | Mohammad Sami   | sami2004@gmail.com          | 6545   | 2024-07-03 07:10:29  | 2024-07-03 07:10:29  | Delete
5   | Dr. Rohan Oberoi| rohnan@test.com             | 123456 | 2024-07-04 05:00:27  | 2024-07-04 05:00:27  | Delete
-----------------------------------------------------------
```

After Deleting Employee with ID 3:

```
EMPLOYEE LIST
-----------------------------------------------------------
ID  | Name            | Email                       | Phone  | Created At           | Updated At           | Operations
-----------------------------------------------------------
4   | Mohammad Sami   | sami2004@gmail.com          | 6545   | 2024-07-03 07:10:29  | 2024-07-03 07:10:29  | Delete
5   | Dr. Rohan Oberoi| rohnan@test.com             | 123456 | 2024-07-04 05:00:27  | 2024-07-04 05:00:27  | Delete
-----------------------------------------------------------
```

### Summary

To delete an employee record from a database table in Laravel, follow these steps:

1. **Add a Delete Link in the View:** Modify the view file to include a delete link for each record.
2. **Define the Route:** Create a route that handles the deletion request.
3. **Implement the Controller Logic:** Add a method in the controller to delete the record and redirect back to the list view.
4. **Test the Functionality:** Verify the deletion process by clicking the delete link and ensuring the record is removed from the table.

### Additional Details

- **Confirmation Dialog:** For better user experience and to avoid accidental deletions, you can add a confirmation dialog before proceeding with the deletion.
- **Soft Deletes:** Instead of permanently deleting records, consider using Laravel's soft delete feature, which marks records as deleted without removing them from the database. This can be achieved by adding the `SoftDeletes` trait to the model.
- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling to manage cases where the deletion might fail, providing appropriate feedback to the user.
