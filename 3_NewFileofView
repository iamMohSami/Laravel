In Resources Folder we have VIEWS as sub-Folder
which contains all our frontend rendering pages

To create a new page :
New File -> home.blade.php

<h1>Home Page</h1>

In order to display this :
Need to add a Route

In Routes folder --
In web.php file --

ADD NEW CODE

Route::get('/home', function () {
return view('home');
});

Thus, on the output on browser,

ON http://127.0.0.1:8000/home
we get : <h1>Home Page</h1>

ON http://127.0.0.1:8000
we get : <h1>Hello</h1>
