MIDDLEWARE GROUP 


What is Middleware Group? 
Grouping of two or more Middlewares together to apply them all together for one route or a group of many routes 
i.e.
Middleware can apply on Single Route : If we want 10(for ex) Middlewares to apply on a single route, instead of assigning each middleware to that route individually, we make a MIDDLEWARE GROUP of that 10 Middlewares and apply it 

Middleware can apply on Route Group: If we want one middleware to apply to 10(for ex) routes

Middleware can apply on all Route : Global Middleware like prev lecture


How to make Middleware group?

Consider we make 2 middlewares AgeCheck and CountryCheck 

php artisan make:middleware AgeCheck

class AgeCheck
{
    /**
     * Handle an incoming request.
     *
     * @param  \Closure(\Illuminate\Http\Request): (\Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response)  $next
     */
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next): Response
    {
        if($request->age < 18) {
            die('You cannot access the webpage coz you are below 18 age') ; 
        }
        echo "Age = " ; 
        echo $request->age ; 
        echo "<br>" ;  
        return $next($request);
    }
}

php artisan make:middleware CountryCheck

class CountryCheck
{
    /**
     * Handle an incoming request.
     *
     * @param  \Closure(\Illuminate\Http\Request): (\Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response)  $next
     */
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next): Response
    {
        if($request->country != 'india') {
            die('You cannot access the webpage coz you are not from INDIA') ; 
        }
        echo "Country = " ; 
        echo $request->country ; 
        echo "<br>" ;  
        return $next($request);
    }
}


IN bootstrap/app.php => 

    use App\Http\Middleware\AgeCheck ; 
    use App\Http\Middleware\CountryCheck ; 

  ->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware) {
        //
        $middleware->appendToGroup('check1' , [
                AgeCheck::class , 
                CountryCheck::class , 
        ]) ; 
    })



                         **   APPLYING  GROUP OF MIDDLEWARES TO A SINGLE ROUTE **
consider we have a new route middlewareCheck.blade.php => 
<div>
    <h3>Successfully passed the Middleware Check</h3>
</div>


In web.php => 
Route::view('/middleware' , 'middlewareCheck')->middleware('check1') ; 


THUS, THIS Successfully ASSIGNES THE GROUP OF 2 MIDDLEWARES TO THIS SINGLE ROUTE 



VERY IMPORTANT NOTE=> 
 IF we want just one global middleware, then there is no need in specifying/assigning it in web.php file, as explained in the #23 video
i.e.

if we do : 
$middleware->append(AgeCheck::class)
Then, no need of "web.php" file, it gets assigned to all routes as a Global Middleware

wheres,

if we do  a GROUP OF MIDDLEARES: 
$middleware->appendToGroup('check1' , [
AgeCheck::class , 
CountryCheck::class,
])

Then, we NEED to assign it in the web.php file => 
Route::view('home' , 'home')->middleware('check1') 



                         **   APPLYING  GROUP OF MIDDLEWARES TO GROUP OF MANY ROUTES **

Route::middleware('check1')->group(function(){
    Route::view('/middleware' , 'middlewareCheck'); 
    Route::view('/route1' , 'middlewareCheck'); 
    Route::view('/route2' , 'middlewareCheck'); 
    Route::view('/route3' , 'middlewareCheck'); 
    Route::view('/route4' , 'middlewareCheck'); ...........
})
