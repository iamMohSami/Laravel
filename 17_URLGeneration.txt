Here, we will learn =


1}What is URL Generation
Displaying the browser URL on our webpage

2}Get current URL and full URL 

we have 2 methods for each which will give same output - 

CURRENT URL -> 
method1 = <h3>{{URL::current()}}</h3>
method2 = <h3>{{url()->current()}}</h3>

FULL URL  ->
method1 = <h3>{{URL::full()}}</h3>
method2 = <h3>{{url()->full()}}</h3>

Difference bw these?
CURRENT URL only gives the URL upto '?' and doest not include the extra parameters passed
FULL URL gives the entire URL and also includes the extra parameters
i.e 
IF BROWSER URL => http://127.0.0.1:8000/home?name=Sami
then,
CURRENT URL OUTPUT => http://127.0.0.1:8000/home
FULL URL OUTPUT => http://127.0.0.1:8000/home?name=sami



3}Get the previous URL

gives the previous URL from where the current URL is reached

method1 = <h3>{{URL::previous()}}</h3>
method2 = <h3>{{url()->previous()}}</h3>

4}Make link URL

We have learned about ANCHOR TAGS i.e. 

we use anchor tags to jump from one page to other
this can also be done with the help of Routes

In our Starting welcome.blade.php page =>
<h1>Hello </h1>
<h3>Click below to go on other Pages</h3>
<a href="/home">Home</a>
<a href="/about/sami">About Sami</a>

THE SAME THING CAN BE IMPLEMENTED USING 
<a href="{{URL::to('home)}}">Home</a>

5}Make URL with child path

<a href="/about/sami">About Sami</a>

This can be IMPLEMENTED as=> 

Route::view('/about/{name}' , 'about') ; 

and 

<a href="{{URL::to('about' , ['sami'])}}">About Sami</a>
