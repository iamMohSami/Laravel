Here, we will use MySQL for DB connection with Laravel 
(MySQL is widely preferred and used with Laravel applications over other DB options like MongoDB or others)
(In Later Lectures, we will also learn how to connect to other DBs with our Laravel app)

STEPS : 
1.Make Database
2.Update Env file
3.Run migration 
4.Make controller and route 
5.Get data from the database



STEP 1 =>  Make a new DB named "LearnLaravel" using phpmyadmin 

STEP 2 => Update .env file and make sure the code is : 
            DB_CONNECTION=mysql
            DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
            DB_PORT=3306
            DB_DATABASE=LearnLaravel
            DB_USERNAME=root
            DB_PASSWORD=

STEP 3 => Run Migration 

If you dont run migration, and serve ur app with only 2 STEPs above, you will get an error : 
ERROR : 

Internal Server Error

Illuminate\Database\QueryException
SQLSTATE[42S02]: Base table or view not found: 1146 Table 'learnlaravel.sessions' doesn't exist (Connection: mysql, SQL: select * from `sessions` where `id` = wSQIAzD3QFMJGugRBu2ZmpVYSRU9fFPOYRRZMmef limit 1)

THUS, to remove this, we run MIGRATION by using : 
php artisan migrate 

IMP NOTEE => 
Before migration, you will see that your DB is completely EMPTY and has NO TABLES initial
After running migration, you will see many TABLES init 



STEP 4 => Make Controller and Route 

php artisan make:controller UserController 

in UserController.php file => 

function users(){
    return "users data" ; 
}

in web.php file => 

use App\Http\Controller\UserController ; 

Route::get('userlist' , [UserController::class , 'users']) ; 



STEP 5 => Get Data from DB

Lets get data from the "users" table in our LearnLaravel DB 
By default, the "users" table is empty, so using phpmyadmin, lets add some data in the table 

IN UserController.php => 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB  ;


function users(){
    return DB::select('select * from users'); 
}

IN web.php => 
Route::get('/userlist' , [UserController::class , 'userlist']) ;

ON BROWSER => http://127.0.0.1:8000/userlist

OUTPUT => 
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Mohammad Sami",
    "email": "mohsami@test.com",
    "email_verified_at": null,
    "password": "1234",
    "remember_token": null,
    "created_at": "2024-06-12 20:55:35",
    "updated_at": "2024-06-12 20:55:35"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Shah Rukh Khan",
    "email": "kingkhan@test.com",
    "email_verified_at": null,
    "password": "9999",
    "remember_token": null,
    "created_at": "2024-06-12 20:56:23",
    "updated_at": "2024-06-12 20:56:23"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Leo Messi",
    "email": "goat@test.com",
    "email_verified_at": null,
    "password": "2023",
    "remember_token": null,
    "created_at": "2024-06-12 20:57:17",
    "updated_at": "2024-06-12 20:57:17"
  }
]

This 5 STEPS help to access the DB data and display it on webpage in JSON format 
















              *** ACCESSING DB DATA WITHOUT RUNNING THE "migration" AND CREATING OWN TABLES *****

Lets, create a new DB, LearnLaravel2 
and here, you create ur own new table named "clients" and specify all the field names and other parameters and also enter some clients data init

AND in .env file => 
CHANGE => SESSION_DRIVER=database   TO SESSION_DRIVER=file 

Thus, this will display the same data on webpage as before
