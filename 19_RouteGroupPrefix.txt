What is Route Grouping??



In Laravel, we have 3 types of Route Grouping : 
1. with Prefix
2. with Controller
3. with Middlewares


                                        ROUTE GROUPING WITH PREFIX
Consider, we have 3 different routes in our web.php file =>

Route::view('student/home' , 'home')
Route::view('student/profile' , 'profile')
Route::view('student/show' , [UserController::class , 'show'])

Now, based on their common prefix "student" , we can make a single GROUP of them which will reduce the redundant use of the word "student" in the path url and also help maintain clean code and easier changes.

SYNTAX TO MAKE A GROUP => 

IN web.php file => 

Route::prefix('student')->group( function(){
    Route::view('/home' , 'home')
    Route::view('/profile' , 'profile')
    Route::view('/show' , [UserController::class , 'show'])
})
