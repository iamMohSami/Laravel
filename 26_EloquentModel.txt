WHAT IS A MODEL?
Part of mvc architecture
This is a PHP file with class , In model, generally, we write BUSINESS LOGIC and DB CONNECTIONS
But in Laravel we mostly do DB related work , 
In Laravel we have an Object-relational mapper (ORM) Feature in the model 




WHAT IS ELOQUENT MODEL and ORM?
In Laravel Model, these models have an extra feature called as  Object-relational mapper (ORM)
It is very easy for ORM to fetch/add/delete data from DB 



MAIN USES OF ELOQUENT MODEL?
Mostly used to access data from table in DB
Used to fetch/update/add/delete/edit data in the DB 

MAKE A NEW TABLE IN DATABASE and CHECK .env file
Here, we made a new table named "students" and inserted data init


MAKE A MODEL : to fetch data from DB
php artisan make:model modelname

VERY IMPORTANT**  WE HAVE 2 NOTES WHILE KEEPING THE "ModelName" => 
1-> Model name always start with Capital Letter
2-> Model name should always be SINGULAR wrt to the PLURAL name of the TABLE we need to fetch the data
i.e. we need data from table "students" 
Thus, we keep our model name as "Student" 
BUT WHY? By doing this, by default, our TABLE gets connected with the MODEL 
{Even if you dont follow this rule, no worry, we can still fix it and achieve same output by adding a single new line of code, but following this rule is a good industry practice}

php artisan make:model Student

by default code => Student.php => 
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Student extends Model
{
    use HasFactory;
}


MAKE A CONTROLLER AND VIEW 
php artisan make:controller StudentController

StudentController.php => 
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class StudentController extends Controller
{
    //
    function showStudents(){
        $data = \App\Models\Student::all() ; 
        return $data ; 
    }
}


In web.php file => 
use App\Http\Controllers\StudentController;
Route::get('/studentsdata' , [StudentController::class , 'showStudents']) ; 


On Browser : http://127.0.0.1:8000/studentsdata
Output : 
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "Name": "Mohammad Sami",
    "Branch": "CSE",
    "CGPA": 8.78
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "Name": "Salahuddin Ayyubi",
    "Branch": "CSE",
    "CGPA": 10
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "Name": "King Baldwin ",
    "Branch": "ECE",
    "CGPA": 5
  }
]


MAKE A NEW VIEW TO DISPLAY THE TABLE DATA => 
php artisan make:view studentsdata

In StudentController.php => 
 function showStudentsTable(){
        $data = \App\Models\Student::all() ; 
        return view('studentsdata' , ['key'=>$data]) ; 
    }

In studentsdata.blade.php view => 
<div>
<h2>Students Data Table</h2>
{{print_r($key)}}
<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Branch</th>
        <th>CGPA</th>
    </tr>
    @foreach ($key as $stud )
        <tr>
            <td>{{$stud->Name}}</td>
            <td>{{$stud->Branch}}</td>
            <td>{{$stud->CGPA}}</td>
        </tr>
    @endforeach
</table>
</div>

in web.php => 
Route::get('/studentsdatatable' , [StudentController::class , 'showStudentsTable']) ; 

NOW, If our MODEL name is not a singular to a plural table name, then how do we connect that table with our model?

In model file, Student.php => ADD ONE LINE -- protected $table="table_name" ;
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Student extends Model
{
    use HasFactory;
    protected $table="table_name" ;
}


MAKING A NEW FUNCTION IN MODEL FILE AND USE IT?

in model file, Student.php => 

class Student extends Model
{
    use HasFactory;

    function myfun(){
        return "This Text comes from a function in Model file" ; 
    }
}

in StudentController.php => 

 function showStudentsTable(){
        $var = new \App\Models\Student ; 
        echo $var->myfun() ; 
        $data = \App\Models\Student::all() ; 
        return view('studentsdata' , ['key'=>$data]) ; 
    }
